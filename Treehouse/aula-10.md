## Next steps
There's so much more to security that we simply can't cover in a single course.

We tried to make sure this course to be a good overview for you at the absolutely basic security steps to take for your software.

We view this course as being more of a dictionary or a primer for topics and areas to watch out for in your own software and tools.

Maybe you found a place or two where you can beef up your security and help protect your users.

Hopefully, you're now feel more empowered to mitigate and even prevent attacks on your own data and systems.

So what now?

Now, is a great time to look back at that list of vulnerabilities from the beginning of the course and think of how you'd address each one if you're not already.

* Why would someone want to gain access to your application or data?

*What are the most likely ways someone would gain that access?

* What data would be the most valuable to an attacker?

* Assuming your application is compromised, how would that impact your users?

* How would it impact your business?

* What processes would you follow to fully recover from an attack?

* And how could someone use your application for other illicit uses?

Investigate stronger more robust hashing and encryption libraries in your languages and frameworks of choice.

Also, look into how your database can handle things like hashing, encryption, access control, and more.

Usually, the more you can do inside of your database, the better.

Also, this might sound counterintuitive, but relying on third party providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud can increase your security, too.

Most Cloud providers also provide their own ACLs, intrusion detection, and other security tools like monitoring.

Much like using Facebook for authentication, you can often get a bigger bang for your buck by letting someone specialized worry about these specific areas.

If you want to learn more about the technologies, techniques and approaches that we covered in this course, look for other courses and workshops, here on Treehouse about them.

We cover subjects like authentication for individual languages and frameworks and their relevant topic areas.

Thank you for joining me on this tour of basic security concerns.
